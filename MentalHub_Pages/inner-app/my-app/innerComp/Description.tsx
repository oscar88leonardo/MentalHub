                  <p className="text-justify m-t-20">
                  Did you know that according to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 300 million people 
                  in the world suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder?, and since the pandemic the cases have 
                  increased by 25% ! (WHO, 2022). <br/><br/>

                  Almost 2-thirds of people with symptoms never seek treatment, this happens for multiple causes. 
                  However, the common features are misinformation, prejudice, and stigma around "mental illness" 
                  and psychological care often associated with insanity and disability (PHO & WHO, 2022) <br/><br/>

                  Aware of this reality and guided by the genuine purpose of helping heal peopleâ€™s suffering, 
                  we propose a digital environment where community con connect with qualified professionals 
                  around mental health services.
